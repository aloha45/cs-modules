**Stacks** is a data structure where the most recently added items are removed first (LIFO).

- Can be implemented using an array or a linked list.
- Useful in certain recursive algorithms that need to push temporary data onto a stack and remove it as it backtracks.

**Queues** is a data structure where items are removed in the same order they were added (FIFO).

- Can be implemented using an array or a linked list.
- It is better to implement these as a linked list to avoid having to shift all the remaining items one position to the left.
